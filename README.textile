"Co-ops are run by dirty hippies; dirty hippies have beards; therefore, this app is called beardo."

h2. No, seriously.

This is a command line interface for "Co-op":http://coopapp.com, since some of us are too cool to use the web interface. It started as a "boston.rb":http://bostonrb.org hackfest project, so blame the pizza and beer if there's bugs.

h2. Wait, what?

It uses "rest-client":http://github.com/adamwiggins/rest-client as a wrapper around the "Co-op API":http://coopapp.com/api

h2. Do I need a beard, too?

No, you don't. All you need is a @.beardorc@ in your @HOME@ directory, with the following info (in YAML format):

<pre>
email: dirty@hippie.com
password: drumcircle
group: 422
</pre>

Then, run @bd "your-message-here"@ and your status on Co-op should be updated.
